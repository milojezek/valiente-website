# Valiente Project Website

I'm creating a new website for a project about model painting and 3D printing. Their current WordPress site is built with Elementor and has a lot of room for improvement. Therefore, we have agreed with the project founder to build the website from scratch with an improved look using VueJS.

The next step will be migrating to a headless architecture. We'll take their existing WordPress and connect it with the newly created website in VueJS.
